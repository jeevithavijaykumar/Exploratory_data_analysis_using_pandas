# Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python

This repository showcases a collection of end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects using Python. 
Each project involves cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting datasets to extract meaningful patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and generate actionable business insights.

## Project Goals

The projects are designed to:

- Import and clean real-world datasets for analysis  
- Perform statistical summaries and descriptive analytics  
- Visualize distributions, trends, and relationships using plots  
- Detect and handle outliers, missing values, and data quality issues  
- Conduct hypothesis testing   
- Generate insights to support data-driven decision-making  
- Summarize key findings and business implications

## Technologies and Tools

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)  
- SciPy (for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing)

Each notebook includes step-by-step analysis with explanations, visualizations, and a final summary of insights for each dataset.
