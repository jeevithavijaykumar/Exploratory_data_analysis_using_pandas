# Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python

This repository showcases a collection of end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects using Python. 
Each project involves cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting datasets to extract meaningful patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and generate actionable business insights.

## Project Goals

The projects involve:

- Importing and cleaning datasets to prepare for analysis  
- Performing statistical summaries and descriptive statistics  
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships  
- Identifying outliers, missing values, and data quality issues  
- Conducting hypothesis testing
- Generating meaningful insights to support data-driven decision-making  
- Summarizing key business insights and findings

## Technologies and Tools

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)  
- SciPy (for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing)

Each notebook includes step-by-step analysis with narrative explanations, visualizations, and a final summary of insights.
